Project Overview
As part of my NYU MS in Business Analytics capstone project, my team and I analyzed XYZ Company’s marketing strategies on Rainforest, focusing on identifying the most effective channels driving conversions. Analyzing the customer journey in path to purchase using eploratory data analysis and statistics, we employed advanced analytic models like Multi-Touch Attribution (MTA) and Markov Models in python and R to optimize marketing spend and enhance customer targeting.

Key Insights
MTA Analysis: Using the Python package channelattribution.io, we performed detailed multi-touch attribution (MTA) modeling to identify the touchpoints that most influenced customer purchases.
Markov Model: Provided a probabilistic view of customer journey paths and attributed conversions to specific ad channels.
MMM Analysis: Leveraged Facebook's Robyn tool for Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM), assessing how marketing efforts impacted overall revenue while accounting for external factors.
Budget Optimization: Recommended strategic shifts in marketing budget towards high-ROI channels like Sponsored Product Ads, Awareness Straming TV and Purchase O&O Display Ads.

Conclusion
Our project delivered actionable insights for XYZ Company, suggesting more effective ad spend allocation and identifying channels with the highest impact on sales. The final output included a real-time dashboard allowing for continuous monitoring and optimization.
