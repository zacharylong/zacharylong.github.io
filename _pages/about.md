I help institutions make faster, better decisions with analytics that leaders actually use.

My story runs from management and creative entrepreneurship to IT consulting and now, data. I translate student academic and HR data into clear data stories and governed data models that leaders and stakeholders trust.

## Now

At SUNY Farmingdale State (Institutional Research), I build enrollment, retention, and academic assessment dashboards in Power BI—modeling Ellucian Banner student data with SQL, star schemas, and DAX—so stakeholders can set schedules, allocate sections, and track student outcomes with confidence.

## What shaped me

- **Program Management (Wipro):** Launched Employee Resource Groups and drove KPIs focused on outcomes over activity for HR leaders.
- **IT Consulting (Capgemini):** Delivered across Project Management + BI + coding (C#, .NET, Java) workstreams.
- **Founder, Photo & Video (11+ years):** [FengLongPhoto, LLC](http://www.fenglongphoto.com/) — Planned and executed complex multi-day wedding events, led on-site crews, delivered on deadlines, and grew market share. Secret sauce: customer empathy + award-winning creative [storytelling](http://youtube.com/channel/UC7uLYA0CK60EZjW6AiWc7sA).
- **Hotel Operations (8 yrs, Marriott):** 24/7 front-of-house management: staffing, scheduling, service recovery, and daily performance.

I live at the intersection of creativity, technology, and business. I’m driven by a passion for using data to enhance human experiences and tell stories.
